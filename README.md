# Constituency Tree Long Short-Term Memory Networks
## Names: Eric Chen, Daniel Lam, Tiffany Wu
This is our Constituency Tree adaptation of [Dasgupta's PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/dasguptar/treelstm.pytorch) of Tree-LSTM as described in the paper [Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075) by Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning.

#### Local Python Environment
To run the code, please go thorugh this sequence of steps in your Python environments:
```
- bash fetch_and_preprocess.sh
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py
```

### Acknowledgements
Thank you to [Riddhiman Dasgupta](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~riddhiman.dasgupta/) for his initial implementation of [Kai Sheng Tai's](https://github.com/kaishengtai/) Tree LSTM.
